README as of 2nd Feb, 2020.

We, Team Klestron, are proud to present you EVARIS, an app launcher that launches educational tools and which is meant to be used by teachers and students for making teaching a better place.

All EVARIS files are stored here. I'm not that experienced in coding too so I also post sample projects here.

The help you can do to make this project grow strong is to make useful changes in the code. That's all I want from you guys.

The packages that EVARIS will have are:

    • Office: LibreOffice
    • Programming: Scratch, Gdevelop, Racket
    • Games: Gcompris, MC:EE
    • Serious study matter: GNU Octave, FisicaLab
    • E-Learning Platforms: Moodle, Khan Academy (Web shortcut-like app)
    • Art: Tux Paint
    • Web browsers: Chromium
    • Chat: Google Hangouts (Web shortcut-like app), Skype
    • Music: GNU Solfege
    And yay that grabs items from the AUR

The packages that EVARIS currently has are:

    • Office: LibreOffice
    • Programming: Scratch, Racket
    • Games: Gcompris
    • Serious study matter: GNU Octave, FisicaLab
    • E-Learning Platforms: Moodle

Some apps in the given list hasn't been included yet. We are looking forward to do that once we get it ready.
Also, you can install other Educational Apps with the terminal.

We believe that items helping to make education better and smarter are one of the greatest inventions ever made.
If you have an educational software you would like to share, feel free to mention it :)
