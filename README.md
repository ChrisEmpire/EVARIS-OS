# evaris-os
README as of 2nd Feb, 2020.

All EVARIS files are stored here. I'm not that experienced in coding too so I also post sample projects here.

EVARIS is a computer os that's based on Arch Linux with xfce. It contains most of the educational packages.

The goal of EVARIS is to make a very simple and elegant UI so teachers and students can learn to use it within 10 minutes.

The help you can do to make this project grow strong is to teach me coding. That's all I want from you guys.

The packages that EVARIS will have currently are:

    • Office: LibreOffice
    • Programming: Scratch, Gdevelop, Racket
    • Games: Gcompris, MC:EE
    • Serious study matter: GNU Octave, FisicaLab
    • E-Learning Platforms: Moodle, Khan Academy
    • Art: Tux Paint
    • Web browsers: Epiphany, Chromium
    • Chat: Google Hangouts, Skype
    • Music: GNU Solfege

We believe that items helping to make education better and smarter are one of the greatest inventions ever made.
If you have an educational software you would like to share, feel free to mention it :)
